  This release supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in agent mode. MCP
  offers a standardized method for AI models to discover and interact with
  external tools, applications, and data sources. When you input a chat prompt
  using agent mode in VS Code, the model can invoke various tools to perform
  tasks such as file operations, accessing databases, or retrieving web data.
  This integration enables more dynamic and context-aware coding assistance.
